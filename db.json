The useId hook helps generate a unique Id on both the client-side and server-side.\nThe previous one was called the useOpaqueIdentifierhook in React. The useOpaqueIdentifierhook had many bugs and limitations, so the useId hook was delayed.\nIn React 18, all the issues were resolved correctly, and the React team introduced the useOpaqueIdentifierhook with the new name useId.\n",

With 60W of power and a promised 15 hours of battery, there’s a lot that they needed to cram into this housing.\n\nIt’s not extremely heavy, but it’s certainly not lightweight. The handle makes it easy to pick up and carry around, and it’s portable enough that it won’t be a struggle to carry it somewhere or out to a pool. There’s an included carrying strap, too, which helps a lot.\n\nYou’ll get two large passive radiators on the sides of the speaker to drive some extra low end thump, and a plastic flap to cover up all the ports to maintain the IPX6 waterproofing on the entire speaker. The buttons on the top of the chassis are large, easy to press, and easy to see, and there’s an LED light strip running along the bottom of the speaker and inside the ends near the passive radiators.\nLoud sound\nIf there’s one word to describe the Bang’s sound profile, it’s loud. Just straight up loud.\n\nWith a 60W power rating, that’s considerably more than the flimsy 2W speakers on your laptop or phone, and three times more oomph than a comparably priced 20W JBL Flip 5 speaker, which is also not a quiet speaker\nLoud sound\nIf there’s one word to describe the Bang’s sound profile, it’s loud.

This bright yellow citrus fruit possesses a distinctive sour taste due to its richness in citric acid. The lemon’s unique flavor makes it a popular ingredient in drinks, desserts, and meals. Almost all parts a lemon can be used in cooking and cleaning.\n\nHealth Benefits\nThe vitamins, fiber, and plant compounds in lemons can provide essential health benefits. The pulp, rind, and juice are rich with vitamins that stimulate immunity and reduce the risk of disease. The soluble dietary fiber in lemon aids in healthy digestion.\n\nLemons can also provide other important health benefits like:\n\nHeart Health\n\nLemons contain about 31 grams of Vitamin C, which is nearly double the amount of Vitamin C needed in your daily diet. Along with boosting immunity, this burst of Vitamin C can reduce your risk of stroke and heart disease with regular consumption.\n\nLemon also contains a high level of dietary fiber, which can reduce risk factors for heart disease by lowering LDL or bad cholesterol. A surplus of cholesterol can lead to atherosclerosis, a hardening of the arteries within the heart.\n\nDigestive Health\n\nLemon contains high amounts of dietary fiber. Fiber, especially soluble fiber, can help reduce constipation and a variety of other gastrointestinal issues and discomfort.\n\nWeight Management\n\nThe pectin fiber found in lemons expands once it is ingested, making you feel full sooner and longer. Lemon water is often advertised as an effective tool in weight loss and weight management. Researchers used mice for this study, and the effects on humans weren’t tested. It’s also important to note that drinking water may keep you full and help you avoid snacking as effectively as lemon.",

            "post": "When it comes to hairstyles, a clean-cut for men is the default. This is why women see men with long hair as mysterious — it’s just not that common. But don’t worry. You can still be the object of female curiosity with a short hairstyle.\n\nClean-cut hairstyles come in different types. There’s the barber’s cut, which is the standard haircut for Pinoy men, the military-inspired crew cut, and the voluminous pompadour, among others. These are low-maintenance cuts that your barber can adjust to suit your face shape and features. If you’re thinking of going short, here are some perks you might enjoy.\n\nIt’s Easy to Maintain\nThe most obvious advantage of a clean-cut hairstyle for men is how fuss-free it is. Ask your barber for a wash-and-wear style that won’t need much primping. Maintenance will only go as far as getting a regular trim, which will keep your cut looking fresh and sharp. Try making an appointment with your barber at least once a month.\n\nIt Dries Quickly\nAsian man holding a towel  \nPat your hair with a towel before air-drying to avoid damage and dandruff.\nWe know this sounds minor, but it can save you from hair woes in the future. Did you know that air-drying your hair can also be harmful? The longer your hair stays wet and retains water, the more the cortex or middle layer of the hair shaft gets damaged. This part of the shaft can swell and break as it tries to hold moisture. Thus, resulting in split ends. Leaving your hair wet for too long can also cause fungal infections, such as dandruff, or dermatitis.\n\nAfter washing your hair with CLEAR Deep Cleanse Anti-Dandruff Shampoo for Men and ridding your hair and scalp of flakes-causing debris, dab your hair with a towel until damp — not wet — then air-dry.",

            "post": "Microbes inhabit just about every part of the human body, living on the skin, in the gut, and up the nose. Sometimes they cause sickness, but most of the time, microorganisms live in harmony with their human hosts, providing vital functions essential for human survival. For the first time, a consortium of researchers organized by the National Institutes of Health has mapped the normal microbial makeup of healthy humans, producing numerous insights and even a few surprises.\n\nResearchers found, for example, that nearly everyone routinely carries pathogens, microorganisms known to cause illnesses. In healthy individuals, however, pathogens cause no disease; they simply coexist with their host and the rest of the human microbiome, the collection of all microorganisms living in the human body. Researchers must now figure out why some pathogens turn deadly and under what conditions, likely revising current concepts of how microorganisms cause disease.\n\nIn a series of coordinated scientific reports published on June 14, 2012, in Nature and several journals in the Public Library of Science (PLoS), some 200 members of the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) Consortium from nearly 80 universities and scientific institutions report on five years of research. HMP has received $153 million since its launch in fiscal year 2007 from the NIH Common Fund, which invests in high-impact, innovative, trans-NIH research. Individual NIH institutes and centers have provided an additional $20 million in co-funding for HMP consortium research.\n\n“Like 15th century explorers describing the outline of a new continent, HMP researchers employed a new technological strategy to define, for the first time, the normal microbial makeup of the human body,” said NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D. “HMP created a remarkable reference database by using genome sequencing techniques to detect microbes in healthy volunteers. This lays the foundation for accelerating infectious disease research previously impossible without this community resource.”\n\nMethods and Results\nThe human body contains trillions of microorganisms — outnumbering human cells by 10 to 1. Because of their small size, however, microorganisms make up only about 1 to 3 percent of the body's mass (in a 200-pound adult, that’s 2 to 6 pounds of bacteria), but play a vital role in human health.\n\nTo define the normal human microbiome, HMP researchers sampled 242 healthy U.S. volunteers (129 male, 113 female), collecting tissues from 15 body sites in men and 18 body sites in women. Researchers collected up to three samples from each volunteer at sites such as the mouth, nose, skin (two behind each ear and each inner elbow), and lower intestine (stool), and three vaginal sites in women; each body site can be inhabited by organisms as different as those in the Amazon Rainforest and the Sahara Desert.\n\nHistorically, doctors studied microorganisms in their patients by isolating pathogens and growing them in culture. This painstaking process typically identifies only a few microbial species, as they are hard to grow in the laboratory. In HMP, researchers purified all human and microbial DNA in each of more than 5,000 samples and analyzed them with DNA sequencing machines. Using computers, researchers sorted through the 3.5 terabases of genome sequence data to identify specific genetic signals found only in bacteria — the variable genes of bacterial ribosomal RNA called 16S rRNA. Bacterial ribosomal RNA helps form the cellular structures that manufacture protein and can identify the presence of different microbial species.\n\nFocusing on this microbial signature allowed HMP researchers to ignore the human genome sequences and analyze only the bacterial DNA. In addition, metagenomic sequencing, or sequencing all of the DNA in a microbial community, allowed the researchers to study the metabolic capabilities encoded in the genes of these microbial communities.\n\n“Recently developed genome sequencing methods now provide a powerful lens for looking at the human microbiome,” said Eric D. Green, M.D., Ph.D., director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, which managed HMP for NIH. “The astonishing drop in the cost of sequencing DNA has made possible the kind of large survey performed by the Human Microbiome Project.”\n\nWhere doctors had previously isolated only a few hundred bacterial species from the body, HMP researchers now calculate that more than 10,000 microbial species occupy the human ecosystem. Moreover, researchers calculate that they have identified between 81 and 99 percent of all microorganismal genera in healthy adults.\n\n“We have defined the boundaries of normal microbial variation in humans,” said James M. Anderson, M.D., Ph.D., director of the NIH Division of Program Coordination, Planning and Strategic Initiatives, which includes the NIH Common Fund. “We now have a very good idea of what is normal for a healthy Western population and are beginning to learn how changes in the microbiome correlate with physiology and disease.”\n\nHMP researchers also reported that this plethora of microbes contribute more genes responsible for human survival than humans contribute. Where the human genome carries some 22,000 protein-coding genes, researchers estimate that the human microbiome contributes some 8 million unique protein-coding genes or 360 times more bacterial genes than human genes.\n\nThis bacterial genomic contribution is critical for human survival. Genes carried by bacteria in the gastro-intestinal tract, for example, allow humans to digest foods and absorb nutrients that otherwise would be unavailable.\n\n“Humans don't have all the enzymes we need to digest our own diet,” said Lita Proctor, Ph.D., NHGRI's HMP program manager. “Microbes in the gut break down many of the proteins, lipids and carbohydrates in our diet into nutrients that we can then absorb. Moreover, the microbes produce beneficial compounds, like vitamins and anti-inflammatories that our genome cannot produce.” Anti-inflammatories are compounds that regulate some of the immune system's response to disease, such as swelling.\n\nResearchers were surprised to discover that the distribution of microbial metabolic activities matters more than the species of microbes providing them. In the healthy gut, for example, there will always be a population of bacteria needed to help digest fats, but it may not always be the same bacterial species carrying out this job.\n\n“It appears that bacteria can pinch hit for each other,” said Curtis Huttenhower, Ph.D., of Harvard School of Public Health and lead co-author for one of the HMP papers in Nature. “It matters whether the metabolic function is present, not which microbial species provides it.”\n\nMoreover, the components of the human microbiome clearly change over time. When a patient is sick or takes antibiotics, the species that makeup of the microbiome may shift substantially as one bacterial species or another is affected. Eventually, however, the microbiome returns to a state of equilibrium, even if the previous composition of bacterial types does not.\n\nClinical Applications\nAs a part of HMP, NIH funded a number of studies to look for associations of the microbiome with diseases and several PLoS papers include medical results. For example, researchers at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston compared changes in the vaginal microbiome of 24 pregnant women with 60 women who were not pregnant and found that the vaginal microbiome undergoes a dramatic shift in bacterial species in preparation for birth, principally characterized by decreased species diversity. A newborn is a bacterial sponge as it populates its own microbiome after leaving the sterile womb; passage through the birth canal gives the baby its first dose of microbes, so it may not be surprising that the vaginal microbiome evolved to make it a healthy passage.\n\nResearchers at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis examined the nasal microbiome of children with unexplained fevers, a common problem in children under 3 years of age. Nasal samples from the feverish children contained up to five-fold more viral DNA than children without fever, and the viral DNA was from a wider range of species. Previous studies show that viruses have ideal temperature ranges in which to reproduce. Fevers are part of the body's defense against pathogenic viruses, so rapid tests for viral load may help children avoid inappropriate treatment with antibiotics that do not kill the viruses but may harm the child's healthy microbiome.\n\nThese are among the earliest clinical studies using microbiome data to study its role in specific illnesses. NIH has funded many more medical studies using HMP data and techniques, including the role of the gut microbiome in Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and esophageal cancer; skin microbiome in psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and immunodeficiency; urogenital microbiome in reproductive and sexual history and circumcision; and a number of childhood disorders, including pediatric abdominal pain, intestinal inflammation, and a severe condition in premature infants in which the intestine actually dies.\n\n“Enabling disease-specific studies is the whole point of the Human Microbiome Project,” said Barbara Methé, Ph.D., of the J. Craig Venter Institute, Rockville, MD, and lead co-author of the Nature paper on the framework for current and future human microbiome research. “Now that we understand what the normal human microbiome looks like, we should be able to understand how changes in the microbiome are associated with, or even cause, illnesses.”\n\nThe NIH Common Fund also invested in a series of studies to evaluate the ethical, legal and social implications of microbiome research. While the results of these studies are yet to be published, a number of important issues already have been identified, ranging from how products designed to manipulate the microbiome — such as probiotic concoctions that include live microorganism believed to benefit the body — might be regulated, to whether individuals should begin to consider storing their microbiome while healthy.\n\nAfter NIH launched HMP in December 2007, the International Human Microbiome Consortium formed in 2008 to represent funding organizations, including NIH, and scientists from around the world interested in studying the human microbiome. The consortium has coordinated research to avoid duplication of effort and insured rapid release of molecular and clinical data sets. It also has developed common data quality standards and tools to share research results.\n\nAs with other large-scale collaborative efforts, NIH ensured that the research community could freely access HMP data through public databases, such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information, part of the National Library of Medicine, and at the HMP Data Analysis and Coordinating Center(link is external).\n\nThe Human Microbiome Project is managed by National Human Genome Research Institute, in partnership with the NIH Office of the Director, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, National Cancer Institute, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, and National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, all part of NIH.\n\nMore information about HMP can be found at http://commonfund.nih.gov/hmp/index.aspx.

            "post": "Recent decisions out of the EU will impact the use of Google Analytics and similar non-European analytics services when targeting EU individuals, with the potential to put many organizations at risk of receiving GDPR fines.\n\nAt issue was the transfer of personal data from the EU to the US through the use of Google Analytics.\n\nThese decisions, like the Schrems decisions, make it clear that organizations must have a technical understanding of their data flows, with an emphasis on: (1) where the data is going; (2) who is receiving the data; and (3) how the data is protected. Many of our clients are using the firm’s technical tool suite, NT Analyzer, to assist with their data protection and privacy efforts.\n\nAn Important Reminder\nIt is important to remember that the analysis should not end with just cookies and Google Analytics. Cookies are only one of many ways to collect/transfer data, meaning Google Analytics and similar services can receive personal data through other means.\n\nFor example, even if a website or app is not utilizing these types of cookies/technologies, the website or app could still send personal data to Google via HTTP parameters, which are sent as part of query string (e.g., www.website.com/pg1/?name=John_Smith (emphasis added)). Additionally, the website or app operator could also use browser/device fingerprinting or other means to track users across web properties. Therefore, it is important to conduct a technical analysis to determine if and how a website or app utilizes these types of services to determine if mitigations are needed.\n\nKey Facts of the Austrian Ruling on the Use of Google Analytics:\n[For a useful primer and additional background on the Data Transfer schemes and Schrems II, please scroll down to the end of this article]\n\nLike the Schrems cases, the recent Austrian NOYB case reviewed the transfer of personal data to the US. The NOYB complaint was aimed at Netdokter.at (Netdokter), an Austrian health website operator that uses Google Analytics and relies on Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) to govern transfers of personal data to Google in the US. NOYB argued that Google qualifies as an “electronic communications service provider” and is therefore subject to Section 702 of FISA, meaning that it can be ordered by public authorities to disclose personal data of EU citizens. Therefore, in light of the Schrems II decision, adequate protection of EU citizen’s personal data cannot be ensured, resulting in an unlawful transfer of personal data to the US.\n\nNetdokter’s Austrian publishing company and Google, however, argued that the data provided to Google, which included IP addresses, other user identifiers, and browser parameters did not qualify as personal data and, even if it did, sufficient supplemental measures were put in place to safeguard the personal data. Safeguards taken by Google included: (1) transparency reporting on data requests from US authorities, (2) encryption at rest in the data centers and (3) pseudonymization of the data.\n\nUltimately, the Austrian DPA sided with NOYB over Netdokter and Google.\n\nSummary of the Rulings in Favor of NOYB:\nThe Austrian DPA held that data transfers to Google in the US in the context of Google Analytics results in a breach of Chapter V of the GDPR, which may make it difficult for EU business and non-EU business having an EU facing website or app to use Google Analytics going forward. Specifically, according to the Ruling:\n\nThe data transferred to Google in the US constitutes personal data under the GDPR, especially given that IP addresses and online identifiers could enable foreign intelligence services to identify an individual; and\nChapter V of the GDPR was violated because:\nGoogle is subject to section 702 FISA as an “electronic communications service provider”;\nThe additional safeguards taken by Google were insufficient at preventing US intelligence services from accessing personal data of EU citizens; and\nFor example, the Austrian DPA stated that encryption was insufficient since US intelligence services could require Google to hand over the decryption key. In addition, the DPA agreed with the German Data Protection Conference’s view that IP addresses and other user identifiers are not considered pseudonymized under recital 28 GDPR since these identifiers are used to make the individual distinguishable and addressable. Further, according to the Austrian DPA, the website operator could share other data elements with Google that could reidentify a data subject even without the IP address.\nNetdokter could not rely on an alternative transfer mechanism.\nThe French CNIL, through a press release, published a similar case last week. Although the CNIL has not yet made its decision public, the press release adopted similar reasoning as the Austrian DPA and ordered an unnamed French website operator to stop using Google Analytics.\n\nNext Steps and Considerations:\nIn the meantime, there are several steps those impacted by these decisions should consider.",

From the Great Pyramids and the Sphinx to the stunning Red Sea coast—there are endless historic, cultural, and recreational sites to visit. As you might expect, Egypt’s food culture is similarly rich.\n\nYou can of course eat all the classic foods like hummus, falafel, stuffed grape leaves, and baklava that are popular throughout the Middle East, North Africa, and the Mediterranean. Egyptian chefs often put their own spin on these beloved foods. You might, for instance, find that your hummus is flavored with cumin.\n\nAnd you’ll also enjoy some distinctive dishes that either originated from Egypt or are specific to Egyptian cuisine: Think ful and kushari, for example. Read on to get some ideas about what to try on your next vacation in Egypt!\n\nEgypt Tours                                                                                                    \n\n- MEZZE (SMALL DISHES)\nWhet your appetite with one or more Egyptian mezze. Popular dishes include:\n\nBaba ghanoush, a delightfully smoky eggplant-based dip commonly eaten throughout the region.\nHummus, the mashed chickpea staple popular in the Middle East and Mediterranean.\nDuqqa, a mix of nuts, herbs, and spices ground into a kind of dip. Look for duqqa mixtures as you visit spice markets. Unlike baba ghanoush and hummus, duqqa is a specifically Egyptian food.\n\n\n- FISH AND SEAFOOD\nIf you’re traveling along the coast or staying in Alexandria, you’ll have great access to fresh fish and seafood. You might order a simple but delicious dish of grilled or fried fish with a side of rice.\n\nVisitors during the springtime Sham el-Nessim festival may see many people eating fesikh, a traditional dish made from a dried, salted, and fermented saltwater fish, the gray mullet, which is caught in the Red and Mediterranean Seas. It’s a tricky food to prepare properly, and definitely an acquired taste!\n\nEgypt Tour Packages\n\n\n\n- VEGETARIAN DISHES\nVegetarians and vegans, take heart: Egypt is an extremely friendly place for plant-based diets. Particularly inland, you’ll find numerous delicious meals prepared from vegetables, legumes, and of course spices. For example:\n\nKushari, a dish with roots in 19th-century Egypt, now consumed at food carts and restaurants nationwide. Ingredients include macaroni, lentils, and rice along with a tomato sauce, and it’s often topped with chickpeas or fried onions. Add a splash of hot sauce if you like!\nEggah, an egg dish not unlike a frittata. There are numerous variations when it comes to fillings, some involving meat, but many including only vegetables and spices: Onions, tomatoes, leeks, zucchini, coriander, cumin, turmeric, and more.\nFul medames, a traditional Egyptian food with a history stretching back centuries. Ful consists of cooked fava beans plus various herbs and spices.\n",
